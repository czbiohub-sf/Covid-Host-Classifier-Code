# Covid-Host-Classifier-Code
This repo contains data and code for some of the analyses in the paper "Development and Validation of a 2-Gene Host Classifier for Rapid COVID-19 Diagnosis and Stability Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants."

These analyses are:
1. Evaluation of 2-gene sets for predicting SARS-CoV-2 positivity using RNA-seq gene expression data from UCSF.
2. Idenitification of best-performing 2-gene sets for predicting SARS-CoV-2 positivity using UCSF data filtered based on rpM values, and evaluation of these 2-gene sets on an external dataset from a study in New York.
3. Evaluation of 2-gene sets on predicting SARS-CoV-2 positivity using local RT-PCR data.

The analyses above correspond to the folders "Cleaned Unf Data", "Cleaned Ct Filtered Data", and "Cleaned PCR Data", respectively.
